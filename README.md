</p>

I am a dedicated Electrical Engineering student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) with a broad and strong passion for software engineering. At the core of this passion is a deep interest in **Algorithms and Data Structures**, which I believe are fundamental to building robust and efficient software. My learning methodology involves in-depth conceptual understanding, practical application through hands-on projects, and sharing my insights.

While I enjoy exploring various facets of software development, including Game Development and Modern Web Technologies as side projects, my technical blog and much of my focused study revolve around **algorithmic problem-solving** and **data structure implementation**.

My primary online presence and established blog, showcasing technical articles, project highlights, and learning notes (especially on Algorithms and Data Structures), is at: 🌐 peienwu.com

This GitHub profile reflects my continuous learning journey and diverse project work.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills & Proficiencies

Through my academic training at NYCU and independent projects, I’ve developed practical proficiencies in the following areas:

* **Programming Languages:** C++, Python
* **Software Engineering Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, Algorithms, Version Control (Git)
* **Tools & Platforms:** GitHub, Vercel, VS Code, Linux Environment (implied from coursework)
* **Web Development:**
    * **Frontend:** Next.js, HTML, CSS
    * **Content Management:** MDX, Hexo
* **Game Development Fundamentals:** C++ based game logic and mechanics.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of efficient algorithms and practical software solutions. My experience with "**資訊之芽培訓計畫算法班**" (NTU's Sprout Training Program - Algorithm Class) and various C++/APCS training has solidified my foundation in **Algorithms and Data Structures**, which I actively apply and document in my blog projects.
