I'm a passionate and curious Software Engineering student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), currently diving deep into the world of modern web technologies and game development.

I enjoy the process of learning, building, and demystifying complex systems. This GitHub profile serves as a "Code Lab" where I document my journey, projects, and explorations.

## 🚀 My Current Focus & Projects

Right now, I'm heavily invested in building and iterating on my personal tech blog:

* 🎮 **[Peienwu's Code Lab (Next.js Version)](https://github.com/peienwu1216/peienwu-blog-next)**
    * My new personal blog built with **Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Contentlayer, and Tailwind CSS**.
    * This is where I'm applying modern web development practices, sharing tech insights, and documenting my learning.
    * Deployed on Vercel: [peienwu-blog-next.vercel.app](https://peienwu-blog-next.vercel.app/)
    * *Status: Actively Developing & Learning*
