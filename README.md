</p>

I am a dedicated Electrical Engineering student at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) with a strong passion for software engineering, particularly in **Game Development** and **Modern Web Technologies**. My approach to learning involves diving deep into concepts, applying them through hands-on projects, and sharing my findings.

My primary online presence and established blog, featuring a collection of my technical articles, project showcases, and learning notes (including **Algorithms and Data Structures**), can be found at:

## 🛠️ Technical Skills & Proficiencies

My academic journey at NYCU (EE) and self-driven projects have equipped me with the following skills:

* **Programming Languages:** C++, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript
* **Web Development:**
    * **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS
    * **Content Management:** MDX, Contentlayer, Hexo
* **Software Engineering Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, Algorithms, Version Control (Git)
* **Game Development Fundamentals:** C++ based game logic and mechanics.
* **Tools & Platforms:** GitHub, Vercel, VS Code, Linux Environment (implied from coursework)

I am particularly interested in the intersection of efficient algorithms and practical software solutions. My experience with "資訊之芽培訓計畫算法班" (NTU's Sprout Training Program - Algorithm Class) and various C++/APCS training has solidified my foundation in **Algorithms and Data Structures**, which I actively apply and document in my blog projects.
